This is also why the redirect must be a 302 (temporary), not a 301 — a 301 lets browsers cache the mapping and skip the server entirely on repeat visits, so the server would never see most clicks. The click event lands on Kafka first (a fire-and-forget write, sent after the redirect response is already on its way back to the user), so the Analytics Service can consume it asynchronously: it increments Redis counters for real-time dashboards and periodically flushes those counters to a durable store for historical queries.',
