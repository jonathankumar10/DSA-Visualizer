/**
 * URL Shortener architecture step trace.
 *
 * Two phases:
 *   write — user submits a long URL → get a short code back
 *   read  — user visits the short URL → gets redirected to the original
 *
 * Node IDs: client | lb | api | cache | db
 *
 * Layout (vertical stack):
 *   client
 *     ↓
 *   lb  (load balancer)
 *     ↓
 *   api (app server)
 *    ↓ ↓
 *  cache  db
 *
 * Step shape:
 *   type         — identifier string
 *   phase        — 'write' | 'read'
 *   activeNodes  — node IDs that glow
 *   activeArrow  — { from: nodeId, to: nodeId } | null
 *   message      — short step label
 *   detail       — longer explanation
 *   shortCode    — null | 'aB3xK9z'  (shown on the short URL badge)
